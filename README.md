😖Whether this plugin is useful to me?😖    

😩Have you encountered any of the following troubles?😩    
1️⃣ Have you ever forgotten the location of TODO tasks created in different Scripts after a certain period of time?        
2️⃣ Do you wish to mark TODO tasks for GameObjects (in scenes or prefabs) that have not been set or modified yet?        
3️⃣ Would you like to mark TODO tasks for Components, such as uninitialized fields in scripts or unfinished work in Text components?        
4️⃣ Are you looking for a task management solution that allows you to locate tasks(any task) with one-click on the unity interface?        
5️⃣ Are you looking for a task management solution that can be used without closing and leaving the Unity interface?

👉For example:    
✔One-click operation in the Unity interface to create TODO tasks.    
✔Creating TODO tasks within any script editor.    
✔Tracking and locating tasks within the Unity project.    
✔Automatically synchronizing and removing tasks from scripts that have been removed, without the need for manual removal.    
✔Integrated interface within Unity, eliminating the need to open any additional software, and so on.
